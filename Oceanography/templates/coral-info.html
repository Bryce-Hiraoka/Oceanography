        <h2>The Coastal Ocean and Coral Reefs</h2>
        <p>The coastal ocean is rich with biodiversity and productivity, resulting from gradients in light, nutrients, temperature, tides, and salinity. Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems in the world, typically found in the <span class="highlight">neritic zone</span>, which includes the shallow waters of the continental shelf.</p>

        <h2>Important Terms to Know</h2>
        <ul class="facts">
            <li><strong>Pelagic:</strong> Refers to the water column, as opposed to the benthic zone, which involves organisms living in or on the seafloor.</li>
            <li><strong>Oceanic Province:</strong> Deep water, seaward of the continental shelf. It is typically sparsely populated due to low nutrient levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Neritic Province:</strong> Shallow ocean waters, from the continental shelf to the low tide line, full of life and high productivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Littoral Province:</strong> The intertidal zone between the high and low tide lines, exposed to air periodically.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Coral Reefs: An Ecosystem in Peril</h2>
        <p>Coral reefs are high-energy, <span class="highlight">neritic, hard-bottom benthic communities</span> found in warm waters, typically between 30°N to 30°S. They are vital to marine life, providing habitat and support for diverse organisms.</p>
        <p>Corals are sensitive to several environmental stressors:</p>
        <ul class="facts">
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Coral reefs are particularly sensitive to temperature changes. When water temperatures are too high, corals expel their symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae), causing coral bleaching and potentially leading to death.</li>
            <li><strong>Acidification:</strong> Increased CO2 levels result in ocean acidification, impacting coral calcification.</li>
            <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Nutrient loading and other pollutants can stress coral reefs and promote harmful algal blooms.</li>
            <li><strong>Sediment:</strong> Excessive sedimentation can block sunlight and hinder photosynthesis in corals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Coral Anatomy and Growth</h2>
        <p>Corals are animals related to jellyfish, living as colonies of individual organisms called polyps. Each polyp secretes calcium carbonate, building the reef structure over time. The structure in which the polyp resides is called a <span class="highlight">corallite</span>. Polyps have tentacles that capture small zooplankton and deliver it to their stomach, with stinging cells called <span class="highlight">nematocysts</span> aiding in defense and feeding.</p>
        <p>Coral reefs grow over thousands of years, with individual polyps lifting off their corallite bases and secreting new calcium carbonate to elevate the reef, adapting to rising sea levels.</p>

        <h2>Coral Reefs and Biodiversity</h2>
        <p>Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse marine ecosystems, with high biodiversity contributing to important ecosystem services, including recreation and food supply. Biodiversity loss due to human activities is a significant concern for marine ecosystems.</p>
        <p><strong>Marine Reserves:</strong> One strategy for preserving biodiversity is establishing a global network of marine reserves. These protected areas can help maintain local populations and promote sustainable fish stocks.</p>

        <h2>Metapopulation Ecology and Connectivity</h2>
        <p>Understanding the connectivity between local fish populations, known as metapopulations, is crucial for managing biodiversity in marine reserves. A metapopulation consists of many local populations that are connected by the movement of individuals, typically through larval dispersal.</p>
        <p>Recent research, including studies by Prof. Buston, has shown that many reef fish tend to stay near the reefs where they were born, with dispersal dropping to near zero at distances of around 30-40 km. For example, research on the <span class="highlight">Goby</span> species in Belize found that the median dispersal distance for juvenile fish was just 1.7 km, with a maximum of 15 km. This challenges old assumptions that fish larvae disperse thousands of kilometers across ocean currents.</p>
        <p>These findings suggest that the "connected" series of marine reserves along the Belizian reef may not be effective for all fish species. A possible solution is to create "stepping stone" reserves that help connect larger, isolated reserves.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul class="facts">
            <li><strong>Coral Bleaching:</strong> This occurs when high water temperatures cause corals to expel their zooxanthellae, leading to a white appearance and loss of energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Coral Reefs and Humans:</strong> Coral reefs provide vital ecosystem services, support fisheries, and contribute to local economies through tourism and fishing.</li>
            <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Some solitary corals, found in colder waters, are more resilient and can survive with or without zooxanthellae.</li>
        </ul>
